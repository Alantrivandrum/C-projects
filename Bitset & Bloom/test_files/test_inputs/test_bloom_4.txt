On the page it looked nothing.
The beginning simple, almost comic.
Just a pulse.
Bassoons and basset horns, like a rusty squeezebox.
And then suddenly, high above it, an oboe.
A single note, hanging there, unwavering.
Until a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight!
This was no composition by a performing monkey!
This was a music I'd never heard.
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling.
It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.
